The most common use for an Ethernet cable is connecting a WiFi router or modem to the internet entry port or telephone line.

## Ethernet Ports on Computers

Ethernet ports can also be referred to as sockets or jacks. The main function of an ethernet port is to create an ethernet connection. Ethernet connections can be create between computers, servers, switches, hubs, routers, modems, gaming consoles, printers and much more. When multiple devices are connected it is called a LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network) or MAN (Metropolitan Area Networks). These types of networks range in different sizes. For the majority of networks in your home it will be a LAN (Local Area Network). One of the vital parts to these network is an ethernet port.

The ethernet port connects one to many different devices. The most common type of connection for an ethernet port is from your computer to your router. By connecting all these devices together we call is hard wiring. It is used to establish an internet connection to your device of choice.

## Troubleshoot Ethernet Port Issues

If your computer experiences internet connectivity issues, the Ethernet port is the first place to look.

Here are three reasons for connectivity issues:

* The network cable is unplugged. This condition often results in a network cable is unplugged error. This error message appears when a computer or laptop is moved, which can knock the cable out of the Ethernet port.
* The network card is unseated. If the computer has been moved around, the Ethernet card may come unseated from the expansion slot on the motherboard.
* Network card drivers are corrupt or missing. Something else related to the Ethernet port is the network driver for the network card, which can become outdated, corrupt, or missing. One of the easiest ways to install a network driver is with a free driver updater tool.
